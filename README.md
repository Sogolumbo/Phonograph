## About this fork
The purpose of this fork is to implement an easy to use and powerful way to manage your playlists. The goals are:
- [x] See whether the selected song is already in a playlist
- [x] See whether multiple songs are already in a playlist
- [x] Do not add songs to playlist which would become duplicates
- [ ] Be able to remove a song which is already in a playlist from it
- [ ] Option to duplicate songs from existing playlists
- [ ] Sync playlists (with other devices, using textfiles in Google Drive)

In the playlist menu checkmarks indicate whether a song/ a number of songs are already in a list.
The brackets around the checkmark shows that only some of the songs are part of the playlist.
